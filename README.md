**Build a SPA (single page application) with the following elements:**

## 1) A header with some kind of logo and a text input box (call the input SI) which is always on top

## 2) A side navigation bar, with 2 menu items:

   a) **Graph**

   b) **Table**

3) [For both Graph and Table you will be pulling stock data from a backend:](https://www.alphavantage.co/query?apikey=demo&function=TIME_SERIES_DAILY_ADJUSTED&symbol=MSFT)

You should create an api key for yourself.

## 4) When showing the Graph element, you should pull data from the backend and display the price of the stock entered in SI (the text input). The link above asks for the data of MSFT (microsoft)

## 5) When showing the Table element, you should pull the same data as in (4) and display it in a table format.
